This is a starting point for Java solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

In this challenge, I built my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, I learned about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

**Note**: Head over to [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

## Start

Requires Java 21 and Maven.

You can run the shell using:
```shell
./your_program.sh

# Inside shell
$ echo Hello World from my own shell!
```
